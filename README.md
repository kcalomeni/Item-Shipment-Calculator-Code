# Item-Shipment-Calculator-Code

I created this code as part of an assignment to create a personal calculator for users to solve their shipping costs effectively. I have 4 total destinations that the users can choose from: USA, Canada, Australia, and Europe. This code is very customizable so it was very easy to add as many options for destinations, shipping costs, and order totals. This was a very intricate assignment that required a steady eye and great typing skills! I really enjoyed creating this!
